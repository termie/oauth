## Description

The OAuth protocol enables websites or applications (Consumers) to access Protected Resources from a web service (Service Provider) via an API, without requiring the User to provide their Service Provider credentials to the Consumer. An example use case is allowing printing service print.example.com (the Consumer), to access private photos stored on photos.example.com (the Service Provider) without requiring the User to provide their photos.example.com credentials to print.example.com.

More generally, OAuth creates a freely-implementable and generic methodology for API
authentication, benefitting developers who want their Consumer product to
interact with various Service Providers.

While OAuth does not require a specific user interface or interaction pattern, recommendations and emerging best practices are described in this specification. Additionally, OAuth does not specify how Service Providers  authenticate Users, making the protocol ideally suited for cases where authentication
credentials are unavailable to the Consumer, such as with OpenID. 

## Background
 
OAuth aims to unify the experience and implementation of delegated web service
authentication into a single, community-driven protocol. OAuth builds on 
existing protocols and best practices that have been independently implemented 
by various websites. An open standard, supported by large and small providers
alike, promotes a consistent and trusted experience for both consumer
application developers and the users of those applications. 

## Definitions 

* Service Provider
: A web application that allows access via OAuth. 
* User
: An individual who has an account with the Service Provider. 
* Consumer
: A website or application that uses OAuth to access the Service Provider on
  behalf of the User. 
* Consumer Developer
: An individual or organization that implements a Consumer. 
* Consumer Key
: A string used by the Consumer to identify itself to the Service Provider. 
* Consumer Secret
: A secret (specific to the Consumer Key) used by the Consumer to sign
  OAuth requests to the Service Provider.
* Protected Resource(s)
: Data controlled by the Service Provider, which the Consumer can access
  through authentication.
* Token
: A string used by the Consumer to gain access to the Protected Resource(s)
  on behalf of the User (instead of using the User's Service Provider credentials).
  There are two types of Tokens: Single-Use and Multi-Use.
* Token Secret
: A secret, specific to a Token, which the Consumer uses to
  sign its OAuth requests to the Service Provider on behalf of a User.
* Single-Use Token
: A Token generated by the Service Provider and given to the
  Consumer to identify the User in the authentication process. The
  Consumer will exchange the Single-Use Token for a Multi-Use Token after the User
  authenticates and grants access permission to the Consumer.
* Multi-Use Token
: A Token generated by the Service Provider and given to the Consumer in order to identify the User in subsequent API requests. 
* Authorization Endpoint URL
: A URL, provided by the Service Provider, that the Consumer uses to obtain
  authorization from the User for access to the Service Provider.
* API Endpoint URL(s)
: URL's provided by the Service Provider, which the Consumer uses to make API
  requests, including obtaining Tokens.
* Callback Endpoint URL
: A URL provided by the a web Consumer, which the Service Provider uses to return a
  Single-Use Token and Token Secret.

## Setting Up to Use OAuth

OAuth includes a Consumer Key and matching Consumer Secret that together authenticate the Consumer (as opposed to the User) to the Service Provider. Customer-specific identification allows the Service Provider to vary access levels to Consumers (such as un-throttled API access or other resources). 

### Service Providers

Service Providers MUST enable Consumer Developers to obtain a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. The process and requirements for provisioning these are entirely up to the Service Providers, except that:

* The Consumer Key MUST be a string suitable for transmission in HTTP request parameters.
* The Consumer Secret may be either a randomized string or a public/private key pair. In the case that the Consumer Secret is a public/private key pair, the Service Provider only requires the public key, and SHOULD verify that the Consumer Developer is, in fact, the owner of the private key.

The Service Provider MUST also provide documentation to specify:

1. The Authorization Endpoint URL and the API Endpoint URLs that the Consumer will use when making OAuth requests.
2. Signature algorithms supported by the Service Provider. See "Recommended Signature Algorithms" for a summary of best practices.
3. Any additional request parameters that the Service Provider requires in order to obtain a Token.

### Consumers

The Consumer Developer MUST obtain a Consumer Key and a Consumer Secret from the Service Provider.

When registering for a Consumer Key, the Consumer Developer MUST identify the Consumer type (website, desktop, mobile, set-top box, etc.). If the Consumer a web-based, the Consumer Developer MUST provide the Callback Endpoint URL where the Service Provider will send OAuth Tokens. For this reason, libraries implementing OAuth for the convenience of Consumer applications MUST support configurable API Endpoint URLs.

## Authenticating with OAuth

OAuth Authentication is done in two broad steps. First, the Consumer MUST obtain a Single-Use Token from the Service Provider by having the the User successfully sign into the Service Provider and grant access. Second, exchange the Single-Use Token for a Multi-Use Token which can be used to make API calls to Service Provider.

There are three variations to the first step of obtaining an authorized Single-Use Token. The variations are based on the Consumer's ability to accept incoming HTTP(S) requests and redirect the User (via web browser) to the Service Provider Authorization Endpoint URL. The three Consumer types are:

* Web-Based Consumer
: A website or other web-based application capable of accepting incoming HTTP(S) requests and User redirection.
* Desktop Consumer
: An application running on a User computer capable of making HTTP(S) requests and User redirection (directly or via a web browser installed on the User computer) but not accepting incoming HTTP(S) requests.
* Direct to Service Provider Consumer
: A Consumer incapable of making HTTP(S) redirections and incapable of accepting incoming HTTP(S) requests.

The second step of exchanging a Single-Use Token for a Multi-Use Token is the same for all Consumer types.

The following sections describe the process for obtaining Single-Use Tokens (for each Consumer type), and obtaining a Multi-Use Token. Each of these subsections is accompanied by a diagram showing the complete authentication process for the Consumer type. 

## Obtaining a Single Use Token for Web-based Consumer Applications

A Web-based consumer follows these steps in order to obtain a valid Single-Use Token:

1. The Consumer requests authorization
2. The Service Provider authenticates User
3. The Service Provider obtains User Consent
4. The Service Provider issues a Single Use Token

![OAuth Web Flow Diagram](/diagrams/oauth_web_flow.png)

### 1. The Consumer Requests Authorization

To request a Single-Use Token and Token Secret, the Consumer constructs an 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' HTTP GET request to the Service Provider's Authorization Endpoint URL, to be sent via the User's User-agent (i.e., web browser). Once the request URL has been generated, the Consumer issues an HTTP 302 Redirect to the Service Provider using that URL.

The request contains the following parameters:

* `oauth_consumer_key`
* `oauth_nonce`
* `oauth_ts`
* `oauth_sigalg`
* `oauth_state`
* `oauth_sig`
* any additional parameters, as defined by the Service Provider

For example, if the Consumer is requesting a Single-Use Token from the Authorization Endpoint URL 'https://sp.example.com/oauth/authorize' with the Consumer Key `0685bd91` the request would be:

      https://sp.example.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_consumer_key=0685bd91

### 2. The Service Provider Authenticates User

The User MUST first sign in to the Service Provider, if they have not done so already.

### 3. The Service Provider Obtains User Consent

The User grants or declines permission for the Service Provider to give the Consumer access to the Provider's API on behalf of the User. Permission MUST be granted for this flow to continue. If the User denies the Consumer access, the Service Provider will not provide the Protected Resources to the Consumer.

### 4. The Service Provider issues a Single Use Token

After the User has authenticated with the Service Provider, and has granted permission for application access, the Service Provider will create a Single-Use Token and a corresponding Token Secret, and deliver it to the Consumer via an HTTP Redirect.

The response for a Web-based Consumer includes the following 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' GET parameters:

* `oauth_token`
* `oauth_secret`
* `oauth_state` (optional)

For example, if the Service Provider has created a Single-Use Token `c3e347b6a5001c16` and Token Secret `678dfge7dghek243` for the Consumer, whose Callback URL is `https://Consumer.example.com/validate`, then the Service Provider will redirect the User to the following URL:

      https://Consumer.example.com/validate?oauth_token=c3e347b6a5001c16&oath_token_secret=678dfge7dghek243

## Obtaining a Single Use Token for Desktop Consumer Applications

Desktop Consumers MUST first obtain a Single-Use Token, since they aren't able to provide a Callback URL to which the Service Provider redirects the User.

1. The Consumer Requests a Single-Use Token
2. The Service Provider issues a Single Use Token
3. The Consumer requests authorization
4. The Service Provider authenticates User
5. The Service Provider obtains User consent
6. The Service Provider Directs the User back to the Consumer Application

![Desktop Flow Diagram](/diagrams/oauth_desktop_flow.png)

### 1. The Consumer Requests a Single-Use Token

To obtain a Single-Use Token, the Consumer sends a request to the Service Provider's API Endpoint URL. This request contains the following parameters:

* `oauth_consumer_key`
* `oauth_nonce`
* `oauth_ts`
* `oauth_sigalg`
* `oauth_sig`

For example, the Consumer has a Consumer Key `1b20acc6` and a Consumer Secret `427a5979d9df7722`. The Service Provider's API Endpoint URL for requesting a Single-Use Token is `http://sp.example.com/oauth/get_su_token`, and the request is using the HTTP GET method. The nonce is `17907867114999140772853922434221488511` and the timestamp of `1186953553`. Using SHA1 as the signing algorithm, the signature is then `26287279e66f7f183af02653e823625871167d16`, and the request is as follows:

      https://sp.example.com/oauth/get_su_token?oauth_consumer_key=1b20acc6&oauth_nonce=17907867114999140772853922434221488511&oauth_ts=1186953553&oauth_sigalg=sha1&oauth_sig=26287279e66f7f183af02653e823625871167d16

### 2. The Service Provider issues a Single Use Token

For example, the Service Provider generates a Single-Use Token `37bb49b4` and a corresponding secret `d0e46c19`, and returns the following as the body of the response:

      token=37bb49b4
      secret=d0e46c19

### 3. The Consumer Redirects the User to the Service Provider

The Consumer redirects the User to the Provider's Authorization Endpoint URL, requesting permission to access the Provider's API on behalf of the User.

This request contains the following parameters:

* `oauth_consumer_key`
* `oauth_token`
* `oauth_nonce`
* `oauth_ts`
* `oauth_sigalg`
* `oauth_sig`

### 4. The Service Provider Authenticates User

The User MUST first sign in to the Service Provider, if they have not done so already.

### 5. The Service Provider Obtains User Consent

The User grants or declines permission for the Service Provider to give the Consumer access to the Provider's API on behalf of the User. Permission MUST be granted for this flow to continue. If the User denies the Consumer access, the Service Provider will not provide the Protected Resources to the Consumer.

### 6. The Service Provider Directs the User back to the Consumer Application

The Service Provider instructs the User to inform the Consumer that authorization has completed.

## Obtaining a Single Use Token for Direct User to Service Provider Consumer Applications

A Single-Use Token and Token Secret will be generated by the Service Provider and presented to the User and the Consumer waits for the User to manually submit them through the Consumer application.

Note: If a Service Provider expects a Consumer to be running on a Mobile device or Set-Top box, the Service Provider SHOULD ensure that the Authorization Endpoint URL and the Single Use Token are short and simple.

1. The Consumer directs the User to request authorization
2. The Service Provider authenticates User
3. The Service Provider obtains User Consent
4. The Service Provider presents a Single Use Token and Token Secret to the User
5. The User enters the Token and Token Secret in the Consumer Application

![Direct to Provider Flow Diagram](/diagrams/oauth_oob_flow.png)

### 1. The Consumer directs the User to request authorization

The Consumer directs the User to the Service Provider's Authorization Endpoint URL

For example, the Consumer is requesting a Single-Use Token and Token Secret from the Service Provider's Authorization Endpoint URL `https://sp.example.com/oauth/authorize` with the Consumer Key `0685bd91`.

      https://sp.example.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_consumer_key=0685bd91

### 2. The Service Provider Authenticates User

The User MUST first sign in to the Service Provider, if they have not done so already.

### 3. The Service Provider Obtains User Consent

The User grants or declines permission for the Service Provider to give the Consumer access to the Provider's API on behalf of the User. Permission MUST be granted for this flow to continue. If the User denies the Consumer access, the Service Provider will not provide the Protected Resources to the Consumer.

### 4. The Service Provider presents a Single Use Token and Token Secret to the User

### 5. The User enters the Token and Token Secret in the Consumer Application

## Obtaining a Multi-Use Token (All Consumer Application Types)

The following requests and responses are the same for all scenarios.

1. Consumer Requests Multi-Use Token
2. Service Provider Grants Multi-Use Token
3. Consumer Accesses API

### 1. Consumer Requests Multi-Use Token

The Single-Use Token and Token Secret will be exchanged for a Multi-Use Token and Token Secret.

#### Request

This request contains the following parameters:
* 'oauth_consumer_key'
* 'oauth_token'
* 'oauth_nonce'
* 'oauth_ts'
* `oauth_sigalg`
* `oauth_sig`

#### Example

### 2. Service Provider Grants Multi-Use Token

The Service Provider exchanges the Consumer's Single-Use Token and Token Secret, generating and sending a Multi-Use Token and Token Secret.

#### Response

The response for a Web-based Consumer includes the following 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' GET parameters:

* 'oauth_token'
* 'oath_token_secret'

#### Example

### 3. Consumer Accesses API

After receiving the Multi-Use Token and Token Secret, the Consumer application will use the Multi-Use Token and Token Secret to access Protected Resources on behalf of the User.

#### Request

This request contains the following parameters:

* `oauth_consumer_key`
* `oauth_token`
* `oauth_nonce`
* `oauth_ts`
* `oauth_sigalg`
* `oauth_sig`

#### Example

### User Interaction Notes for All Scenarios

Once the Service Provider has authenticated the User, the Service Provider MUST present the User with the option to grant access to the Consumer and specify:
* which Protected Resources the Consumer is requesting,
* for how long the Consumer will have access to the resources,
* any other service-specific information about the authorization that will be granted to the Consumer.

If the User grants permission, the Service Provider SHOULD retain information about the transaction, including the Token, associated User, Consumer data, and the Requested Resources.

#### Signing an API Request 

All OAuth API requests MUST be signed by the Consumer and the signature verified
by the Service Provider. The following steps describe the signature process: 

##### OAuth Request Parameters

All are REQUIRED except where stated.
 
* `oauth_consumer_key`
: A Consumer Key. This is an arbitrary Consumer application specific identifier. 
* `oauth_secret`
: The Consumer Secret that corresponds to the Consumer key. 
* `oauth_token`
: A Token. See the "Obtaining a Token" sections. 
* `oauth_token_secret`
: A  Token Secret. See the "Obtaining a Token" sections.
* `oauth_nonce`
: A one-time use value to verify the request has not been made before. See the
  "Generating Nonces" section. 
* `oauth_ts`
: An integer representing the time of request, expressed in number of
  seconds after January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT.
* `oauth_sigalg`
: The hashing algorithm that the Consumer used to sign the request. 
* `oauth_sig`
: The signature. 

##### Format of Request Parameters 

The request parameters MUST be concatenated in the following order:
 
    oauth_secret, oauth_consumer_key, oauth_token, oath_token_secret,
    http_request_method, http_request_uri, normalized_request_parameters,
    oauth_nonce, oauth_ts 

After the Consumer has normalized the request parameters (see below), the
following signing algorithm SHALL be used to generate the value of the
`oauth_sig`: 

1. generate an oauth_nonce (see Generating Nonces) 

2. normalize OAuth Request Parameters
   1. Escape the request parameter values using the percent-encoding (%xx) mechanism described in RFC3986.
   2. Concatenate the parameters resulting in name-value pairs separated by the
      ASCII '=' symbol.
      e.g., "oauth_secret=elephant" and "oauth_consumer_key=foo"

3. Concatenate the resulting name-value pairs into one string separated by the ASCII '&'
   symbol in the following order: 

    oauth_secret, oauth_consumer_key, oauth_token, http_request_method,
    http_request_uri, normalized_request_parameters, oauth_nonce, oauth_ts

4. sign or hash the concatenated string according to the chosen value of oauth_sigalg: 

    oauth_sig = md5(concatenated_string) 

    oauth_sig = sha1(concatenated_string) 

    oauth_sig = hmac_sha256(oauth_secret, concatenated_string)

    oauth_sig = openssl_x509_sign(private_certificate, concatenated_string)
    (in the case of using x509 certs, the Service Provider would have the
    Consumer's public key and therefore would provide an empty string as
    the secret)

##### Example

1. Fetch the 3rd page of friends updates from Twitter for user 123456
2. The basic API request looks like so:

      http://twitter.com/statuses/with_friends/123456.json?page=3&count=50

3. Assuming the use of the SHA1 signature method and the following values:
	* oauth_secret => 3a2cd35
	* oauth_consumer_key => 0685bd91
	* oauth_token => 540ad18
	* oauth_token_secret => x2s55k0
	* oauth_nonce => MTgzNTYxODk4Mw
	* oauth_ts => 1185517832

       oauth_sig = SHA1("oauth_secret=3a2cd35&oauth_consumer_key=0685bd91&oauth_token=540ad18&oauth_token_secret=x2s55k0&http_request_method=GET&http_request_uri=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fstatuses%2Ffriends/123456.json&normalized_request_parameters=count%3D50%26page%3D3&oauth_nonce=MTgzNTYxODk4Mw&oauth_ts=1185517832")

4. We need to pass to the server (in cleartext) the Consumer Key (`oauth_consumer_key`),
   the Token (`oauth_token`), the timestamp (`oauth_ts`), the nonce
   (`oauth_nonce`), the signing algorithm (oauth_sigalg), and the signed
   request (`oauth_sig`).
   Consumers MUST NOT send any of the secrets with the request, since doing so
   would compromise the entire request, as well as subsequent requests.
5. The full signed request is then:

    GET http://twitter.com/statuses/friends/123456.json?page=3&count=50&oauth_key=0685bd91&oauth_token=540ad18&oauth_nonce=MTgzNTYxODk4Mw&oauth_ts=1181537927&oauth_sigalg=sha1&oauth_sig=2d047740b53ae16f670750bef5bb5c2a0f398f30

### Normalizing Request Parameters

The Consumer MUST first normalize request parameters by following the steps
below. OAuth Request Parameters (see above) MUST NOT be included in this
process. The normalized string MUST then be used when generating the signature
for a request.

1. Escape the request parameter names and values using the percent-encoding
   (%xx) mechanism described in RFC3986.
1. Sort the request parameters alphabetically by parameter name. If two or
   more parameters share the same name, then sort those parameters by their
   values.
   e.g., "count=50", "page=3"
   e.g., "count=3", "count=50", "page=3"
2. Concatenate the parameters resulting in name-value pairs separated by the
   ASCII '=' symbol.
   e.g., "count=50" and "page=3"
3. Concatenate the name-value pairs into one string separated by the ASCII '&'
   symbol.
   e.g., count=50&page=3

The encoding and format of the parameter names and their values MUST NOT be changed
during this process.  The Service Provider will perform this same set of steps
when verifying the signature.

### Generating Nonces

A nonce is a random string, uniquely generated for each request. The nonce
allows the Service Provider to verify that this request has never been made
before and helps prevent against replay attacks. More information about nonces
can be found on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce).

### Using HTTP-Authorization Headers

This section defines an RFC 2617 extension to support OAuth.  It uses the standard Authorization and WWW-Authenticate headers to pass credentials rather than using URL parameters. All Consumers SHOULD be able to supply an OAuth Authorization header as an alternative to passing URL parameters. It is RECOMMENDED that Service Providers accept such a header and such Service Providers MUST signal Consumers by returning the OAuth WWW-Authenticate header upon all requests for the Protected Resource. For the remainder of this section, we assume that the Service Provider under discussion has chosen to support this extension.

When using a HTTP-Authorization header, the OAuth Request Parameters are not included in the body of the request. Rather they are included as the value of the header.

    Authorization: OAuth oauth_token="540ad18" oauth_key="0685bd91" oauth_nonce="MTgzNTYxODk4Mw" oauth_ts="1185517832" oauth_sigalg="SHA1" oauth_sig="2d047740b53ae16f670750bef5bb5c2a0f398f30"

To reject a request that lacks appropriate credentials, the Service Provider MUST respond with a 401 Unauthorized response. Such a response MUST include at least one OAuth WWW-Authenticate header and MAY include additional WWW-Authenticate headers:

    401 Unauthorized
    ...
    WWW-Authenticate: OAuth

A Consumer MAY also include an empty, token-less OAuth Authorization header on any HTTP request to inform a Service Provider that it supports OAuth. The Service Provider MUST then respond with the appropriate WWW-Authenticate header for the requested resource in the response. For example, a Consumer could inquire using HEAD and then adjust its UI if the Service Provider supports OAuth.

### Implementation Suggestions

Timestamps SHOULD be good for 5 minutes, this gives sufficient time to deal with network latency, without becoming a security hole, or placing an unbearable burden on the server for tracking and storing nonces. Ideally, servers would provide a method for retrieving what they think the current time is.

## Error Messages

* HTTP 400 Bad Request
  * Invalid Timestamp
  * Unsupported Signing Algorithm
* HTTP 401 Unauthorized
  * Invalid Consumer Key
  * Invalid Token
  * Invalid Signature
  * Nonce Spent

## Security Considerations

* Credentials as GET params can get logged in various places

## Open Questions

* Proposed UI for User authentication with the Service Provider? Too many protocols just leave user authentication interaction as a hand-wavy step. It would be great to at least provide best practices and/or sample mock-ups. - Rich Conlan, 08/14/07 8:27 AM 

* HTTP Headers
  * Not mandated, but having a standard for including OAuth in the
    HTTP_AUTHORIZATION header would be nice.
