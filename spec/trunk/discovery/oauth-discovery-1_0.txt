## Description

The OAuth Core protocol describes a framework for exchanging user credentials with tokens, which in turn provide access to protected resources. The Core specification focuses on two main aspects, the token exchange flow and using signatures to make that flow secure. The Core specification leaves it up to each implementation to specify how they should relay important protocol details, such as endpoint URLs and establishing Consumer Keys.

The Discovery specification aims to provide a machine-readable interface that will relay all the required OAuth information allowing a fully automated interaction between Consumers and Services Providers. While it cannot define the endpoints used for accessing resourcs, as those are service-specific, it does creates a framework on which they can be described.

## Notation and Conventions 

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Definitions

This specification uses terms defined in the OAuth Core specification as well as new dicovery-specific terms:

* Something
: Else.
