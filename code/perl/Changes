	Added support for Consumer Request (token-less / two-legged) message type

0.14    Sat, 13 Dec 2008 17:29:36 UTC
	Add POD for consumer requests

0.15    Fri, 05 Jun 2009 00:48:07 UTC
	Added Twitter demo consumer
	Warn if message parameter is already UTF-8 that it will be double-encoded; see I18N section of Net::OAuth manpage
	Better handling of missing 'realm' parameter in Authorization header methods
	Better handling of request_url parameter; see REQUEST_URL PARAMETER section of Net::OAuth manpage
	Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=44699 - encode spaces to %20 rather than + in $message->to_url()

0.16   Mon, 15 Jun 2009 18:36:17 UTC
  Added support for OAuth 1.0A - see POD section 'OAUTH 1.0A' for details - Net::OAuth still defaults to 1.0 for now

0.17   Thu, 25 Jun 2009 16:59:50 UTC
  Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=47293 - Message->from_hash was validating using the incorrect class, causing a 'Parameter X not valid for a message of type Y' message on V1.0a messages.  Thanks Jeff Dairiki!

0.18   Thu, 25 Jun 2009 17:18:04 UTC
  Fixed accidental (though probably harmless) regression in 0.17

0.19   Fri, 26 Jun 2009 17:30:06 UTC
  Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47369 - Don't automatically set oauth_version parameter when message is created via from_hash (or from_url, from_post_body, etc).  Thanks COSIMO!

0.20   Fri, 13 Nov 2009 18:56:55 UTC
  Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=48867 - error in synopsis - thanks Adam Taylor!
  Removed UTF8 double-encoding warning.  Now Net::OAuth::Message::encode() uses Encode::is_utf8() to determine if the input is already UTF-8 encoded.  If so, it runs decode_utf8() on it before sending it to uri_escape_utf8().  Thanks Hector Garcia Alvarez!
  Potentially fixed an issue found by Marc Mims, where HMAC_SHA1 was failing to load, breaking some CPAN tests.  Build.PL now explicitly requires Digest::SHA1 and Encode.  Hopefully that fixes it.
