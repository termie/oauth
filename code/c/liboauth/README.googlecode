liboauth - POSIX std-C99 OAuth.net implementation

The c sources of liboauth are provided under MIT license. 
This excludes the build-environment, xmalloc and optional libcurl integration.

A packaged version is available from http://liboauth.sf.net/ in terms of the
GNU Lesser General Public License.

For the 1.0 milestone we aim to release the complete library under MIT license,
but currently lack the time to complete this task with the required diligence.
