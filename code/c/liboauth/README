liboauth is a collection of c functions implementing the http://oauth.net API.

liboauth provides basic functions to escape and encode stings according to
oAuth specifications and offers high-level functions built on top to sign
requests or verify signatures.

The included documentation in the doc/ folder and example code from tests/ 
can also be found online at http://liboauth.sourceforge.net/

 == License and Notes ==

If configured with '--enable-lgpl' the GNU Lesser General Public License 
applies otherwise the code can be distributed under MIT license.

The difference is xmalloc - which is under LGPL. The MIT licensed code
may segfault when it encounters an out-of-memory error.

 == Test and Example Code ==

After Complilation `make check` can be used to perform a offline selftest.

There is also example code to perform and verify oAuth requests online,
but they are not run automatically.
