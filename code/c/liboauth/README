liboauth is a collection of c functions implementing the http://oauth.net API.

liboauth provides basic functions to escape and encode stings according to
oAuth specifications and offers high-level functions built on top to sign
requests or verify signatures.

The included documentation in the doc/ folder and example code from tests/ 
can also be found online at http://liboauth.sourceforge.net/

While the oauth source-code itself is under MIT license, this package 
integrated with xmalloc (and possibly libcurl) is licensed under LGPL.
