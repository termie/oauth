The base64 code is used with permission from Jan-Henrik 
Haukeland <hauk@tildeslash.com>.

escape_url() contains code from curl by Daniel Stenberg <daniel@haxx.se>

cheers to Arjan <arjan@scherpenisse.net> for using and testing this code; and 
Ralph Meijer <ralphm@ik.nu> for fixing the debian package and quality control.

Kudos to Marc Worrel - http://www.marcworrell.com/ - for an introduction
to the oAuth API and helping to get this project alive. And last but not 
standing ovations to the http://oauth.net team who made it possible in i
the first place.

Marc Powell suggested minor changes and contributed patches to make this 
library more usable.
